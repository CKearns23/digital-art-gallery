Chloë's Digital Art Gallery

Hi! This is my digital art gallery project, where I’ve combined some of my favorite pieces into an interactive, easy-to-navigate website. I wanted to create a space where art feels accessible and fun, whether you’re on your phone or a computer.

What It Includes

Image Carousel: A slider that rotates through featured artworks.
Gallery Section: A grid view for exploring even more pieces.
Video Section: A space for videos, like art reels or process clips.
Responsive Design: It looks good on any screen size!
What I Used to Make It

Vue.js: For making the website interactive.
Swiper.js: To build the image carousel.
HTML & CSS: For the structure and styling.
JavaScript: For adding functionality.
How to Run It

If you want to check it out for yourself:

Download or clone the project from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital-art-gallery.git
cd digital-art-gallery
Open the folder and look for these files:

styles.css
Open index.html in any browser, and the site will load!
What I Plan to Add

I’m always looking to improve! Some ideas I have for the future:

A zoom feature for the gallery images.
Animations to make the site even smoother.
Maybe some filters so people can explore artwork by theme or style.
