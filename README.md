Chloë's Digital Art Gallery

Hi! This is my digital art gallery project, where I’ve combined some of my favorite pieces into an interactive, easy-to-navigate website. I wanted to create a space where art feels accessible and fun, whether you’re on your phone or a computer.

What It Includes:

Image Carousel: A slider that rotates through featured artworks.
Gallery Section: A grid view for exploring even more pieces.
Video Section: A space for videos, like art reels or process clips.
Responsive Design: It looks good on any screen size!

What I Used to Make It:

Vue.js: For making the website interactive.
Swiper.js: To build the image carousel.
HTML & CSS: For the structure and styling.
JavaScript: For adding functionality.

How to Run It:
If you want to check it out for yourself:

1. Download or clone the project from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital-art-gallery.git
cd digital-art-gallery

2. Open the folder and look for these files:
